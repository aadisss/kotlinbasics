## How It Works
1. The game prompts the user to enter their choice (`Rock`, `Paper`, or `Scissors`).
2. The computer generates a random choice:
   - 1 → Rock
   - 2 → Paper
   - 3 → Scissors
3. The winner is decided using the rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Paper beats Rock
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Same choice → Tie
4. The result is displayed in the console.
